	abstract = {Substituting noble metals for high-index dielectrics has recently been proposed as an alternative strategy in nanophotonics to design broadband optical resonators and circumvent the Ohmic losses of plasmonic materials. In this paper, we demonstrate that subwavelength silicon nanoantennas can manipulate the photon emission dynamics of fluorescent molecules. In practice, we show that dielectric nanoantennas can both increase and decrease the local density of optical states at room temperature, a process that is inaccessible with noble metals at the nanoscale. Using scanning probe microscopy, we analyze quantitatively, in three dimensions, the near-field interaction between a 100-nm fluorescent nanosphere and silicon nanoantennas with diameters ranging between 170 and 250 nm. Associated with numerical simulations, these measurements indicate increased or decreased total spontaneous decay rates by up to 15\% and a gain in the collection efficiency of emitted photons by up to 85\%. Our study demonstrates the potential of silicon-based nanoantennas for the low-loss manipulation of solid-state emitters at the nanoscale and at room temperature.},

Recent work demonstrates that the precision of such measurements can be substantially improved by tailoring the spatial profile of light fields used for estimating an observable system parameter4–10. These advances naturally raise the intriguing question of which states of light can provide the ultimate measurement precision11. Here we introduce a general approach to determine the optimal coherent states of light for estimating any given parameter, regardless of the complexity of the system. Our analysis reveals that the light fields delivering the ultimate measurement precision are eigenstates of a Hermitian operator that quantifies the Fisher information from the system’s scattering matrix12. To illustrate this concept, we experimentally show that these maximum information states can probe the phase or the position of an object that is hidden by a disordered medium with a precision improved by an order of magnitude compared with unoptimized states. Our results enable optimally precise measurements in arbitrarily complex systems, thus establishing a new benchmark for metrology and imaging applications3,13.},

As a remarkable consequence, the average precision that can be achieved when estimating the particle’s properties is the same in the ballistic and in the diffusive scattering regime, independently of the particle’s position within its nonabsorbing environment. This invariance law breaks down only in the regime of Anderson localization, due to increased C0-speckle correlations.

In this paper, we illustrate how speckle illumination, as a particular type of structured illumination, can be exploited to perform optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy with a single-pixel imaging approach. We first introduce the principle of single-pixel detection applied to photoacoustic imaging and then illustrate in 2 different situations how photoacoustic images may be computationally reconstructed from speckle illumination: In the first situation where the speckle patterns are known through a prior calibration, various reconstruction approaches may be implemented, which are demonstrated experimentally through both scattering layers and multimode optical fibers; in the second situation where the speckle patterns are unknown (blind structured illumination), the so-called memory effect can be harnessed to produce calibration-free photoacoustic images, following the approach initially proposed for fluorescence imaging through thin scattering layers.},

Experimentally, our approach simply requires to translate random speckle patterns at the input of a square-core fiber and to measure the resulting fluorescence intensity with a bucket detector. The image of the fluorescent object is then reconstructed from the autocorrelation of the measured signal by solving an inverse problem. This strategy does not require the knowledge of the fragile deterministic relation between input and output fields, which makes it promising for the development of flexible minimally invasive endoscopes.},
