I did my PhD at ESPCI Paris, during which I studied light-matter interaction at the nanoscale. I then worked on waves in complex media as a post-doc at ESPCI Paris, Utrecht University (the Netherlands) and Universit√© Grenoble Alpes. I am now pursuing these activities as a CNRS researcher in an interdisciplinary laboratory of physics ([LIPhy](https://liphy.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/en)) in Grenoble, working with optical and acoustic waves. I have always enjoyed tackling challenges in physics as an experimentalist but also through numerical and theoretical approaches.

Besides physics, I like to spend time in the mountains around Grenoble, especially for rock climbing.
