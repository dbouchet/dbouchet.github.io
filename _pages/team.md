<h3>About me</h3>

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-7 mt-3 mt-md-0">

<p align="justify"> 
I did my PhD at <a href="https://www.institut-langevin.espci.fr/home?lang=en">Institut Langevin</a> (<a href="https://www.espci.psl.eu/en">ESPCI Paris</a>, France), during which I studied light-matter interaction at the nanoscale. I then worked on waves in complex media as a post-doc, first at the <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/research/debye-institute-for-nanomaterials-science">Debye Institute for Nanomaterials Science</a> (<a href="https://www.uu.nl/en">Utrecht University</a>, the Netherlands), and then at the <a href="https://liphy.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/en">Interdisciplinary Laboratory of Physics</a> in Grenoble (<a href="https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/english/">Université Grenoble Alpes</a>, France). I am now working in this lab as a researcher employed by the <a href="https://www.cnrs.fr/en">CNRS</a>, studying the propagation of both light waves and acoustic waves in complex media. I have always enjoyed tackling challenges in physics as an experimentalist but also through numerical and theoretical approaches.

Besides physics, I like to spend time in the mountains around Grenoble, especially for rock climbing.
